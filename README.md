# BloodCrest

BloodCrest is the official continuation of NeXan Warcraft. We are just a group of veteran 60 twink players As much as most, we adore how vanilla was, so simple yet complex. We are using NeXan's original source, and with our 15+ years of total expertise, we plan on making the most of it, and returning better than ever!
